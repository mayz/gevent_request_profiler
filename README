Gevent Request Profiler
=======================

The Gevent Request Profiler enables the discovery of blocking/non-yielding
code in request-handling servers implemented with the Gevent networking library
(http://www.gevent.org/).

Culprits may include blocking I/O (e.g., file I/O, native I/O, or non-
monkey-patched socket requests) and CPU-intensive code.

Unlike the cProfile module, it is not a deterministic profiler that precisely
measures the run-times of all function calls. Rather, it identifies
'execution spans', intervals during which greenlets do not cooperatively yield
to other greenlets, for a set fraction of requests.
